To avoid implicit type conversion issues:

1. Ensure that data types match between your query and table columns.
2. Use explicit type casting where necessary.
3. Avoid relying on implicit behavior, instead be explicit.

To avoid unexpected row count issues:

1. Verify the data integrity of your table to check for unexpected values or missing rows.
2. Check for referential integrity violations, ensuring that all foreign keys have corresponding primary key values.
3. Use appropriate `WHERE` clauses to filter out or include only the required data.
4. Use `COUNT(*)` to check the number of rows returned before using your query in a larger program.

Example of improved SQL (handling potential type conversion):

SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales' AND CAST(salary AS DECIMAL(10,2)) > 100000; 

This cast helps ensure that you are comparing a numeric value to a numeric value, avoiding implicit data conversion problems.

Always ensure that you test your SQL queries thoroughly and review the data and your tables to ensure data integrity.
